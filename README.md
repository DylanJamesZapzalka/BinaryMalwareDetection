# Graph Convolutional Neural Network Malware Classification Techniques

## Description
The following repository contains code for extracting the data from malware binaries, datasets for binary classification and authorship attribution,
and models to run over aforementioned datasets.

## Datasets
There are two types of datasets in this repository: datasets containing a control flow graphs extracted features and datasets for graph convolutional neural networks that contain a binaries control flow graph as well as its node feature vectors.

For the former, the data is in a text file and can be loaded however the user wishes.

For the latter, datasets must be loaded through their respected classes located in the datasets.py file. When a dataset object is created, it will try and see if it is already processed and downloaded onto your system. If not, it will process the data in the zip files and install it to your machine in the [user]/.spectral directory. This dataset can then be processed and passed to a model through the spektral.data.BatchLoader class.

### APT
The APT dataset is used for the purpose of authorship attribution. It contains the control flow graph of each binary as well as word embedded vectors of 934 assembly instructions for each of its nodes. Be cautious when downloading this dataset; there is currently no support for sparse node feature vectors, so the extracted dataset is 180GB.
It contains the following files by the following authors:

### Binary
The Binary dataset is used for the purpose of classifying binaries as benign or malicious. It contains the control flow graph of each binary as well as word embedded vectors of 775 assembly instructions for each of its nodes.
It contains the following files:

## Models
All of the models used throughout this repository can be located in the models.py class.

## Analysis Files
The analyis files are used for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the models over their given datasets.

## Feature Extraction Files
There are two different files for extracting the featuers of software binaries: gnn_feature_extraction.py and cfg_feature_extraction.py.

The former is for extracting a binaries control flow graph and a word embedded feature vector for each node. This data is to be used for graph convolutional neural networks.

The latter is for extracting the features from a binaries control flow graph. Each example will be a single vector used for traditional neural networks.
